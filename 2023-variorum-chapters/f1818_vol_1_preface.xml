            <p>This file is developed from a process of collating five distinct editions for
                                                the <title level="m">Frankenstein Variorum</title> digital edition on

            <p>The <title level="m">Frankenstein Variorum</title> digitally compares five versions of the novel <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> prepared between 1816 and 1831.
                                                <abbr>fMS</abbr> refers to the manuscript notebooks dated roughly 1816 to 1818 and stored in three boxes at the Bodleian library in Oxford.
                                                <abbr>f1818</abbr> refers to the first anonymous publication of Frankenstein in 1818. <abbr>fThomas</abbr> refers to a copy of the 1818 edition left by 
                                                Mary Shelley with her friend Mrs. Thomas in Italy before she left for England after the death of Percy Shelley. This copy contains 
                                                handwritten marginalia indicating edits she would make if there were ever a new edition, and apparently was not available for Mary Shelley to consult later.
                                                <abbr>f1823</abbr> refes to the published edition prepared by William Godwin, the first to feature Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley’s name as the author. 
                                                <abbr>f1831</abbr> refers to a heavily revised version prepared by Mary Shelley in 1831 for Bentley's Standard Series of novels.

I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors. The event on <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_008" n="viii"/>which the interest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical fact, affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can yield. </p>

        conform to this rule; and the most humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours, may, without presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the highest specimens of poetry. </seg>

        partly as a source of amusement, and partly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind. Other motives were mingled with these, as the work pro<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_010" n="x"/>ceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition of the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind. </seg>

               <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_011" n="xi"/>It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this story was begun in the majestic region where the scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_012" n="xii"/>myself agreed to write each a story, founded on some supernatural occurrence. </p>

The following tale is the only one which has been completed.
