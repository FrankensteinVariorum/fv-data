He was a highly skilled archer and swordsman. In some versions of the legend he is depicted as being of noble birth. Having fought in the Crusades, he returns to England to find his lands have been taken by the Sheriff. In other versions he is instead born into the yeoman class. He is said to have robbed from the rich to give to the poor.",

WE SHOULD RETHINK THIS WHOLE PASSAGE ON DOMESTIC AFFECTIONS AND HER LINKAGE OF SCIENTIFIC WILL TO POWER AND THE VIOLENCE OF EMPIRE BUILDING IN ROME AND THE AMERICAS. WE'RE ANNOTATING THESE REFERENCES TOO SEPARATELY. I SUGGEST ONE ANNOTATION FOR THIS LAST CRUCIAL SENTENCE. IT'S NOT ABOUT GREEKS ENSLAVING OTHERS, BUT IT'S MAKING A LINK BETWEEN ROMAN EMPIRE BUILDING AND THE SAME PROCESS IN THE AMERICAS NORTH AND SOUTH.

I\n         was\n         easily led by the sympathy which he evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give\n         utterance to the burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that\n         warmed\n         me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the\n         furtherance of my enterprise. One man\u2019s life or death were but a small price to pay\n         for\n         the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought; for the dominion I should acquire\n         and\n         transmit over the elemental foes of our race.

I paused;\n         \u2014at length he spoke, in broken accents:\u2014\u201cUnhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have\n         you\n         drank also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,\u2014let me reveal my tale, and you will\n         dash the cup from your lips!\u201d\n      \n      \n      Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief\n         that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose\n         and\n         tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.\n      \n      \n      Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for\n         being\n         the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to\n         converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years.\n         The\n         tale was quickly told: 16but it awakened various trains of\n         reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend\u2014of my thirst for a more intimate\n         sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and expressed my conviction\n         that a man could boast of little happiness, who did not enjoy this blessing.\n      \n      \n      \u201cI agree with you,\u201d replied the stranger; \u201cwe are unfashioned creatures, but half\n         made\n         up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves\u2014such a friend ought to be\u2014do not lend\n         his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.",

Caroline notices a comely blonde girl \"of a different stock\" among the dark-eyed, Italian \"vagrants.\" When Caroline learns that Elizabeth is the daughter of a Milanese nobleman and a German woman she decides that Elizabeth and Victor should someday marry. Thus the potential implication of incest in 1818, when Victor eventually weds his cousin, is erased in 1831.  For the scholarly controversy, SEE (find articles/books)",

In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of\n         modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir\n         Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside\n         the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of\n         natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy\u2019s apprehensions,\n         as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.\n      \n      \n      The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their\n         practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled\n         the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.\n         He\n         might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\n         in\n         their secondary and tertiary grades were 27utterly\n         unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to\n         keep\n         human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had\n         repined.\n      \n      \n      But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I\n         took\n         their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange\n         that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine\n         of\n         education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard\n         to\n         my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with\n         a\n         child\u2019s blindness, added to a student\u2019s thirst for knowledge.
