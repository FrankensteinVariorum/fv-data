""Percy Bysshe Shelley, feigning the author's being abroad, handled the negotiations for a contract to publish Frankenstein, thus preserving Mary Shelley's anonymity. That he first sought out John Murray, Byron's publisher, may indicate that Byron himself suggested such an avenue to the Shelleys. Whatever the case, Murray declined the manuscript, upon whose refusal Shelley reverted to his own publisher Charles Ollier. When Ollier, too, declined to accept the book, the Shelleys were in something of a quandary. They resolved it by turning to a publishing house—Lackington's—that had a large inventory and specialized somewhat in sensational materials.""

All is not theirs, it seems;

One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called,
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidden
Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord
Envy them that? Can it be sin to know?
Can it be death? And do they only stand
By ignorance? Is that their happy state,
The proof of their obedience and their faith?
O fair foundation laid whereon to build
Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds
With more desire to know, and to reject
Envious commands, invented with design
To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt
Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such,
They taste and die: What likelier can ensue
But first with narrow search I must walk round
This garden, and no corner leave unspied;
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side,
Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw
What further would be learned.","","/p[68]","/p[68]",292,343

Whatever the case, Murray declined the manuscript, upon whose refusal Shelley reverted to his own publisher Charles Ollier. When Ollier, too, declined to accept the book, the Shelleys were in something of a quandary. They resolved it by turning to a publishing house—Lackington's—that had a large inventory and specialized somewhat in sensational materials.""

All is not theirs, it seems;

One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called,
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidden
Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord
Envy them that? Can it be sin to know?
Can it be death? And do they only stand
By ignorance? Is that their happy state,
The proof of their obedience and their faith?
O fair foundation laid whereon to build
Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds
With more desire to know, and to reject
Envious commands, invented with design
To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt
Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such,
They taste and die: What likelier can ensue
But first with narrow search I must walk round
This garden, and no corner leave unspied;
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side,
Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw
What further would be learned.","","/p[68]","/p[68]",292,343
