Erasmus Darwin had made \"not of impossible occurrence\" that one presently visible species could mutate into another. Victor contemplates this possibility\u2014as an alarming one\u2014when he speculates in Volume 3, Chapter 3, that the Creature's demand that he create a \"mate\" could result in a new evolutionary development, \"a race of devils.\"",

In his review of the first edition in 1818 for *Edinburgh Magaizine*, Sir Walter Scott seems cognizant of the shift in consciousness. He notes: \"The real events of the world have, in our day, too, been of so wondrous and gigantic a kind--the shiftings of the scenes in our stupendous drama have been so rapid and various, that Shakespeare himself, in his wildest flights, has been completely distanced by the eccentricities of actual existence.\"",

I had hitherto\n            attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion\n            of my education, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my\n            native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day\n            resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred&#8212;an omen, as it\n            were, of my future misery. <pb n=\"062\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_074\"/>Elizabeth had caught\n            the scarlet fever; but her illness was not severe, and she quickly recovered. During her\n            confinement, many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from\n            attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard\n            that her favourite was recovering, she could no longer debar herself from her society,\n            and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was past. The consequences\n            of this imprudence were fatal. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was very\n            malignant, and the looks of her attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\n            death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this admirable woman did not desert her. She\n            joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself: &#8220;My children,&#8221; she said, &#8220;my firmest hopes of\n            future <pb n=\"063\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_075\"/>happiness were placed on the prospect of\n            your union.

I regret that I am taken\n            from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But\n            these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\n            death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.&#8221;</p>\n          "

But this state of mind had place only in\n            the first steps towards knowledge: the more fully I entered into the science, the more\n            exclusively I pursued it for its own sake. That application, which at first had been a\n            matter of duty and resolution, now became so ardent and eager, that the stars often\n            disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</p>\n          "

Cautionary tales about technology and hubris were not only frequent in Shelley's time but have proliferated. In Karel \u010capek's *R.U.R* (1920), for example, robots confound expectations by violently rebelling against their creators.

For this I had deprived myself of\n            rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now\n            that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust\n            filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of\n            the room, and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind\n            to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and I threw\n            myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\n            But it was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought\n            I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted\n            and surprised, I em<pb n=\"100\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_112\"/>braced her; but as I imprinted\n            the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features\n            appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a\n            shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the\n            flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth\n            chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the\n            moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters, I beheld the wretch&#8212;the\n            miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes,\n            if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\n            inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did\n            not hear; one hand was <pb n=\"101\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_113\"/>stretched out, seemingly to\n            detain me, but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard\n            belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night,\n            walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and\n            fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to\n            which I had so miserably given life.</p>\n          "

My uncle was almost\n            persuaded that you were indeed dangerously ill, and could hardly be restrained from\n            undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. Clerval always writes that you are getting better;\n            I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own hand-writing;\n            for indeed, indeed, Victor, we are all very miserable on this account.

Your father&#8217;s health is\n            now so vigorous, that he appears ten years younger since last winter. Ernest also is so\n            much improved, that you would hardly know him: he is now nearly sixteen, and has lost\n            that sickly appearance which he had some years ago; he is grown quite robust and\n            active.</p>\n          "

He can no longer be a fit\n            subject for pity; the survivors are the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the\n            only consolation. Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and that the mind\n            of man ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence of a beloved object, ought\n            not to be urged. Even Cato wept over the dead body of his brother.&#8221;</p>\n          "

The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always\n            the effect of solemnizing my mind, and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I\n            determined to go alone, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of\n            another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.</p>\n          "

By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed\n            upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and\n            troubled me; but <pb n=\"033\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_037\"/> hardly had I felt this, when, by\n            opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked, and, I\n            believe, descended; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before,\n            dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now\n            found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either\n            surmount or avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat\n            wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the\n            forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue,\n            until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant\n            state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the\n            ground. I slaked my <pb n=\"034\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_038\"/>thirst at the brook; and then\n            lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p>\n          "

This was a new sight to me; and I examined the structure\n            with great cu<pb n=\"041\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_045\"/>riosity. Finding the door open, I\n            entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.\n            He turned on hearing a noise; and, perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and, quitting the\n            hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared\n            capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight,\n            somewhat surprised me.

How miraculous did this appear!\n            the huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged my admiration by turns. The\n            vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some\n            of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered; but I had\n            hardly placed my foot within the door, before the children shrieked, and one of the\n            women fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some at<pb n=\"043\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_047\"/>tacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of\n            missile weapons, I escaped to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in a low\n            hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in\n            the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance;\n            but, after my late dearly-bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge\n            was constructed of wood, but so low, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No\n            wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\n            although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from\n            the snow and rain.</p>\n          "

It was indeed a paradise, compared to the bleak\n            forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my\n            breakfast with pleasure, and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\n            water, when I heard a step, and, looking <pb n=\"046\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_050\"/>through a\n            small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my\n            hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\n            cottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue\n            petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited, but not\n            adorned; she looked patient, yet sad. I lost sight of her; and in about a quarter of an\n            hour she returned, bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she\n            walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance\n            expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took\n            the pail from her head, and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they\n            disappeared. Presently I saw the young <pb n=\"047\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_051\"/>man again,\n            with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also\n            busied, sometimes in the house, and sometimes in the yard.</p>\n          "

I found that these people\n            possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by\n            articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or\n            pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a\n            godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled\n            in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and the words\n            they uttered, not having any apparent connexion with visible objects, I was unable to\n            discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great\n            application, however, and after having re<pb n=\"059\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_063\"/>mained\n            during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names\n            that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied\n            the words <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi1\">fire</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi2\">milk</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi3\">bread</hi>, and <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi4\">wood</hi>. I learned also the names of the\n            cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but\n            the old man had only one, which was <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi5\">father</hi>. The girl was called \n              <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi6\">sister</hi>, or <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi7\">Agatha</hi>; and the youth <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi8\">Felix</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi9\">brother</hi>, or <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi10\">son</hi>. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated\n            to each of these sounds, and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other\n            words, without being able as yet to understand or apply them; such as <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi11\">good</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi12\">dearest</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_p9_hi13\">unhappy</hi>.</p>\n          "

The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as\n            sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\n            cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me.\n            Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she\n            endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and\n            tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was\n            not thus with Felix. He <pb n=\"061\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_065\"/>was always the saddest of\n            the groupe; and, even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply\n            than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful\n            than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.</p>\n          "

I learned\n            from Werter&#8217;s imaginations despondency and gloom: but Plutarch taught me high thoughts;\n            he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the\n            heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had\n            a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and\n            boundless seas. But I was <pb n=\"103\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_107\"/>perfectly unacquainted\n            with towns, and large assemblages of men.

I read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring\n            their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for\n            vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as\n            I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course\n            led to admire peaceable law-givers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus\n            and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\n            firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a\n            young soldier, burning for glory and <pb n=\"104\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_108\"/>slaughter, I\n            should have been imbued with different sensations.</p>\n          "

At these moments I took refuge in\n            the most perfect solitude. I passed whole <pb n=\"003\" xml:id=\"F1818_v3_007\"/>days on\n            the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds, and listening to the rippling of\n            the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to\n            restore me to some degree of composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my\n            friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.</p>\n          "

Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in\n            such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the main land, which was\n            about five miles distant.</p>\n          "

To you first entering on life, to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how can\n            you understand what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the least\n            pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with\n            me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps, and, when\n            I most murmured, would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.\n            Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the exhaustion, a repast was\n            prepared for me in the desert, that restored and inspirited me. The fare was indeed <pb n=\"141\" xml:id=\"F1818_v3_145\"/>coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate; but\n            I may not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me.\n            Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight\n            cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.</p>\n          "

We may survive; and\n          if we do not, I will repeat the lessons of my Seneca, and die with a good heart.</p>\n        "

I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror: I\n          abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of\n          its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness; that while he accumulated\n          wretchedness and despair upon me, he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from\n          the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation\n          filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat, and resolved\n          that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture;\n          but I was the slave, not the master of an impulse, which I detested, yet could not\n          disobey. Yet when she died!&#8212;nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast <pb n=\"184\" xml:id=\"F1818_v3_188\"/>off all feeling, subdued all anguish to riot in the\n          excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but\n          to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion of my\n          demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last\n          victim!&#8221;</p>\n        "

Akin to Victor Frankenstein, Prometheus is also credited with the creation of man, which he fashions out of clay. As punishment for the disobedience, Zeus condemns Prometheus to eternal torment: he is chained to a rock for eternity while an eagle feeds on his liver. Shelley\u2019s husband Percy would later take up the Prometheus myth in the closet drama *Prometheus Unbound*, published in 1819. Reading the novel against the myth, we can understand Prometheus\u2019s punishment for the Gods akin to Victor\u2019s psychological torment for defying nature.",
