Critics of the novel have not often followed this lead in thinking about it as an early work in the British evolutionary imagination. Erasmus Darwin had made \"not of impossible occurrence\" that one presently visible species could mutate into another. Victor contemplates this possibility\u2014as an alarming one\u2014when he speculates in Volume 3, Chapter 3, that the Creature's demand that he create a \"mate\" could result in a new evolutionary development, \"a race of devils.\"",

In his review of the first edition in 1818 for *Edinburgh Magaizine*, Sir Walter Scott seems cognizant of the shift in consciousness. He notes: \"The real events of the world have, in our day, too, been of so wondrous and gigantic a kind--the shiftings of the scenes in our stupendous drama have been so rapid and various, that Shakespeare himself, in his wildest flights, has been completely distanced by the eccentricities of actual existence.\"",

Do you understand this feeling?\n          This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a\n          foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my day dreams become\n          more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost\n          and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and\n          delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the\n          horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There&#8212;for with your leave, my sister, I will\n          put some trust in preceding navigators&#8212;there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing\n          over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders <pb n=\"003\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_015\"/>and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the\n          habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the ph&#230;nomena of\n          the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be\n          expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which\n          attracts the needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial observations, that require only\n          this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my\n          ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread\n          a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are\n          sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death, and to induce me to commence this\n          laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks <pb n=\"004\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_016\"/>in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up\n          his native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the\n          inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by\n          discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many\n          months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all\n          possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>\n        ",

In Shelley's time, the source of the earth's magnetism was a mystery and  adventurers like Robert Walton set out to the North and South Poles seeking scientific answers and public glory. ",

Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable\n            manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown\n            and in wretchedness.

It advanced from behind the\n            mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various\n            quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with\n            curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire\n            issue from an old and beautiful oak, <pb n=\"057\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_069\"/>which stood\n            about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak\n            had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next\n            morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the\n            shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbands of wood. I never beheld any thing so utterly\n            destroyed.</p>\n          ",

I had hitherto\n            attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion\n            of my education, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my\n            native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day\n            resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred&#8212;an omen, as it\n            were, of my future misery. <pb n=\"062\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_074\"/>Elizabeth had caught\n            the scarlet fever; but her illness was not severe, and she quickly recovered. During her\n            confinement, many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from\n            attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard\n            that her favourite was recovering, she could no longer debar herself from her society,\n            and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was past. The consequences\n            of this imprudence were fatal. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was very\n            malignant, and the looks of her attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\n            death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this admirable woman did not desert her. She\n            joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself: &#8220;My children,&#8221; she said, &#8220;my firmest hopes of\n            future <pb n=\"063\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_075\"/>happiness were placed on the prospect of\n            your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my\n            love, you must supply my place to your younger cousins. Alas! I regret that I am taken\n            from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But\n            these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\n            death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.&#8221;</p>\n          ",

I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which\n            modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures, and cultivated\n            the acquaintance, of the men of science of the university; and I found even in M. Krempe\n            a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\n            physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I\n            found <pb n=\"079\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_091\"/>a true friend. His gentleness was never\n            tinged by dogmatism; and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good\n            nature, that banished every idea of pedantry. It was, perhaps, the amiable character of\n            this man that inclined me more to that branch of natural philosophy which he professed,\n            than an intrinsic love for the science itself. But this state of mind had place only in\n            the first steps towards knowledge: the more fully I entered into the science, the more\n            exclusively I pursued it for its own sake. That application, which at first had been a\n            matter of duty and resolution, now became so ardent and eager, that the stars often\n            disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</p>\n          ",

Romantic liberals like the Shelleys, Leigh Hunt, and Lord Byron idealized the republic as a political form and set it against militaristic empire building. However, Mary Shelley is original in associating \"domestic affections\" with the idea of a republic based on reason.",

For this I had deprived myself of\n            rest and health.

I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth\n            chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the\n            moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters, I beheld the wretch&#8212;the\n            miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes,\n            if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\n            inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did\n            not hear; one hand was <pb n=\"101\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_113\"/>stretched out, seemingly to\n            detain me, but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard\n            belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night,\n            walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and\n            fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to\n            which I had so miserably given life.</p>\n          ",

For example, as early as 1762, Jean-Jaques Rousseau wrote in *The Social Contract* that \"There is no man so bad that he cannot be made good for something. No man should be put to death, even as an example if he can be left to live without danger to society.\"",

The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always\n            the effect of solemnizing my mind, and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I\n            determined to go alone, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of\n            another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.</p>\n          ",

This was the\n            forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue,\n            until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.

How miraculous did this appear!\n            the huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged my admiration by turns. The\n            vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some\n            of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered; but I had\n            hardly placed my foot within the door, before the children shrieked, and one of the\n            women fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some at<pb n=\"043\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_047\"/>tacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of\n            missile weapons, I escaped to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in a low\n            hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in\n            the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance;\n            but, after my late dearly-bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge\n            was constructed of wood, but so low, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No\n            wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\n            although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from\n            the snow and rain.</p>\n          ",

It was indeed a paradise, compared to the bleak\n            forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my\n            breakfast with pleasure, and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\n            water, when I heard a step, and, looking <pb n=\"046\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_050\"/>through a\n            small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my\n            hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\n            cottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue\n            petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited, but not\n            adorned; she looked patient, yet sad. I lost sight of her; and in about a quarter of an\n            hour she returned, bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she\n            walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance\n            expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took\n            the pail from her head, and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they\n            disappeared. Presently I saw the young <pb n=\"047\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_051\"/>man again,\n            with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also\n            busied, sometimes in the house, and sometimes in the yard.</p>\n          ",

I found that these people\n            possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by\n            articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or\n            pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a\n            godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled\n            in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and the words\n            they uttered, not having any apparent connexion with visible objects, I was unable to\n            discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great\n            application, however, and after having re<pb n=\"059\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_063\"/>mained\n            during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names\n            that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied\n            the words <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi1\">fire</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi2\">milk</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi3\">bread</hi>, and <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi4\">wood</hi>. I learned also the names of the\n            cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but\n            the old man had only one, which was <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi5\">father</hi>. The girl was called \n              <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi6\">sister</hi>, or <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi7\">Agatha</hi>; and the youth <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi8\">Felix</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi9\">brother</hi>, or <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi10\">son</hi>. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated\n            to each of these sounds, and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other\n            words, without being able as yet to understand or apply them; such as <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi11\">good</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi12\">dearest</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter11_div4_div12_p9_hi13\">unhappy</hi>.</p>\n          ",

I learned\n            from Werter&#8217;s imaginations despondency and gloom: but Plutarch taught me high thoughts;\n            he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the\n            heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had\n            a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and\n            boundless seas. But I was <pb n=\"103\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_107\"/>perfectly unacquainted\n            with towns, and large assemblages of men.

I read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring\n            their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for\n            vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as\n            I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course\n            led to admire peaceable law-givers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus\n            and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\n            firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a\n            young soldier, burning for glory and <pb n=\"104\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_108\"/>slaughter, I\n            should have been imbued with different sensations.</p>\n          ",

But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and\n            sorrowful?&#8221; In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts, and neither saw the descent of\n            the evening star, nor the golden sun-rise reflected in the Rhine.&#8212;And you, my friend,\n            would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\n            eye of feeling and delight, than to listen to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch,\n            haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.</p>\n          ",

Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated\n            by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed\n            on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been\n            a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as\n            if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.\n            &#8220;I have seen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the\n            lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicu<pb n=\"016\" xml:id=\"F1818_v3_020\"/>larly to the water, casting black and impenetrable\n            shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it not for the most\n            verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake\n            agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water, and gave you an idea\n            of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean, and the waves dash with fury the\n            base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an\n            avalanche, and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of\n            the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud: but this\n            country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland\n            are more majestic and strange; but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river, \n            <pb n=\"017\" xml:id=\"F1818_v3_021\"/>that I never before saw equalled. Look at that\n            castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed\n            amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from\n            among their vines; and that village half-hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely,\n            the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man, than\n            those who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our\n            own country.&#8221;</p>\n          ",

He later praises the republican opponent of Charles I, John Hampden. What version of England's political past Mary Shelley means to commemorate in this chapter remains an interesting question.",

As punishment for the disobedience, Zeus condemns Prometheus to eternal torment: he is chained to a rock for eternity while an eagle feeds on his liver. Shelley\u2019s husband Percy would later take up the Prometheus myth in the closet drama *Prometheus Unbound*, published in 1819. Reading the novel against the myth, we can understand Prometheus\u2019s punishment for the Gods akin to Victor\u2019s psychological torment for defying nature.",

He asked me the history of my earlier years.\n         The\n         tale was quickly told: 16but it awakened various trains of\n         reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend\u2014of my thirst for a more intimate\n         sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and expressed my conviction\n         that a man could boast of little happiness, who did not enjoy this blessing.\n      \n      \n      \u201cI agree with you,\u201d replied the stranger; \u201cwe are unfashioned creatures, but half\n         made\n         up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves\u2014such a friend ought to be\u2014do not lend\n         his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.",

There\n         was a\n         sense of justice in my father\u2019s upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he\n         should\n         approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from\n         the\n         late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set a greater\n         value\n         on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my\n         mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by\n         reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\n         her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour\n         to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove\n         to\n         shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind,\n         and\n         to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft\n         and\n         benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,\n         had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed\n         previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public\n         functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy,\n         and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\n         as a restorative for her weakened frame.\n      \n      \n      From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples,\n         and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their\n         only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible\n         stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother\u2019s tender\n         caresses, and my father\u2019s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my\n         first\n         recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better\u201421their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed\n         on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their\n         hands\n         to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards\n         me.\n         With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had\n         given\n         life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined\n         that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of\n         charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but\n         one\n         train of enjoyment to me.\n      \n      \n      For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desire to have a daughter,\n         but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making\n         an\n         excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake\n         of\n         Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.\n         This,\n         to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion,\u2014remembering what\n         she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,\u2014for her to act in her turn the\n         guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings\n         of\n         a vale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\n         of\n         half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day,\n         when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited\n         this\n         abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour,\n         distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which\n         attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The\n         four\n         others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin, and very fair.\n         Her\n         hair was the brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed\n         to\n         set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes\n         cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility\n         and\n         sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species,\n         a\n         being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\n      \n      \n      22The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed\n         eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.\n         She\n         was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German,\n         and\n         had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to\n         nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest\n         child\n         was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in\n         the\n         memory of the antique glory of Italy,\u2014one among the schiavi ognor\n            frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the\n         victim of its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the dungeons of\n         Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his child became an orphan and\n         a\n         beggar. She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer\n         than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\n      \n      \n      When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa,\n         a child fairer than pictured cherub\u2014a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her\n         looks, and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The\n         apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic\n         guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence\n         had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\n         and\n         want, when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their\n         village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my\n         parents\u2019 house\u2014my more than sister\u2014the beautiful and adored companion of all my\n         occupations and my pleasures.\n      \n      \n      Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which\n         all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening\n         previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,\u2014\u201cI have a\n         pretty present for my Victor\u2014to-morrow he shall have it.\u201d And when, on the morrow,\n         she\n         presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness,\n         interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine\u2014mine to protect,\n         love, and 23cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I\n         received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the\n         name\n         of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she\n         stood to me\u2014my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      CHAPTER II.\n      \n       We were brought up together; there was not quite a year\n         difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion\n         or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast\n         that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer\n         and\n         more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\n         application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied\n         herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and\n         wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home\u2014the sublime shapes of the mountains;\n         the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life\n         and\n         turbulence of our Alpine summers,\u2014she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\n         While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent\n         appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to\n         me a\n         secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden\n         laws\n         of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest\n         sensations I can remember.\n      \n      \n      On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely\n         their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a\n         house\n         in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the\n         lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally\n         in the latter, and 24the lives of my parents were passed\n         in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself\n         fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general;\n         but I\n         united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval\n         was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He\n         loved\n         enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read in books\n         of\n         chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of\n         enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into\n         masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of\n         the\n         Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem\n         the\n         holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.\n      \n      \n      No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were\n         possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not\n         the\n         tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of\n         all\n         the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly\n         discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement\n         of filial love.\n      \n      \n      My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my\n         temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire\n         to\n         learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the\n         structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states,\n         possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired\n         to\n         learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of\n         nature\n         and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed\n         to the\n         metaphysical, or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\n      \n      \n      Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.\n         The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme;\n         and his hope and his dream was to become one among those 25whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our\n         species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our\n         peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance\n         of her\n         celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit\n         of\n         love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through\n         the\n         ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own\n         gentleness. And Clerval\u2014could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?\u2014yet\n         he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity\u2014so full\n         of\n         kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded\n         to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim\n         of\n         his soaring ambition.",

After sending the manuscript of Mathilda to William Godwin, he told Shelley he found the depiction of incest \"disgusting and detestable,\" and refused to return the manuscript to his daughter.\n\nSee Janet Todd's edition of Mary's novel:Shelley, Mary. *Matilda; with Mary and Maria*, by Mary Wollstonecraft.

In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of\n         modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir\n         Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside\n         the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of\n         natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy\u2019s apprehensions,\n         as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.\n      \n      \n      The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their\n         practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled\n         the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.\n         He\n         might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\n         in\n         their secondary and tertiary grades were 27utterly\n         unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to\n         keep\n         human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had\n         repined.\n      \n      \n      But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I\n         took\n         their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange\n         that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine\n         of\n         education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard\n         to\n         my favourite studies.

My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the\n            students; and my proficiency, that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with\n            a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on? whilst M. Waldman expressed the most\n            heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I\n            paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some\n            discoveries, which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can\n            conceive of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as others have\n            gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is\n            continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity, which closely\n            pursues one study, must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\n              con<pb n=\"081\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_093\"/>tinually sought the attainment of one object\n            of pursuit, and was solely wrapt up in this, improved so rapidly, that, at the end of\n            two years, I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments,\n            which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I had arrived at\n            this point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural\n            philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\n            residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to\n            my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.</p>\n          ",

But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\n            rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade,\n            than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a\n            slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; a disease that I regretted\n            the more because I had hitherto en<pb n=\"096\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_108\"/>joyed most\n            excellent health, and had always boasted of the firmness of my nerves. But I believed\n            that exercise and amusement would soon drive away such symptoms; and I promised myself\n            both of these, when my creation should be complete.</p>\n        ",

You are forbidden to write\u2014to hold a pen;\n         yet\n         one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long\n         time\n         I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained\n         my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering\n         the\n         inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey; yet how often have I regretted\n         not being able to perform it myself!

My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a\n         military career in a distant country; but Ernest never had your powers of application.\n         He looks upon study as an odious fetter;\u2014his time is spent in the open air, climbing\n         the\n         hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler, unless we yield\n         the\n         point, and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\n      \n      \n      \u201cLittle alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since\n         you\n         left us.

There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the\n          horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There&#8212;for with your leave, my sister, I will\n          put some trust in preceding navigators&#8212;there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing\n          over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders <pb n=\"003\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_015\"/>and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the\n          habitable globe.

What may not be\n          expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which\n          attracts the needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial observations, that require only\n          this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my\n          ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread\n          a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are\n          sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death, and to induce me to commence this\n          laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks <pb n=\"004\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_016\"/>in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up\n          his native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the\n          inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by\n          discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many\n          months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all\n          possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>\n        ",

The first version had made a special point of indicating how this family education was not inculcated by punishments, but presented to the children as an adventure in knowledge, as well as preparing Victor for the kind of rigorous study he would later undertake in the modern sciences.\n     Instead of this pedagogical detail, Mary generalizes about Victor's happy childhood and replaces the details of education with the idea of a \"religious and sacred feeling\" that is inimical to the secular education described in 1818.

Whence, I often asked myself,\n            did the <pb n=\"082\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_094\"/>principle of life proceed? It was a bold\n            question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things\n            are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not\n            restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined\n            thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy\n            which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural\n            enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost\n            intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I\n            became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also\n            observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father\n            had taken the <pb n=\"083\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_095\"/>greatest precautions that my mind\n            should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have\n            trembled at a tale of superstition, or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.\n            Darkness had no effect upon my fancy; and a church-yard was to me merely the receptacle\n            of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had\n            become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay,\n            and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses. My attention was fixed\n            upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw\n            how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death\n            succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the\n            eye and brain. I <pb n=\"084\" xml:id=\"F1818_v1_096\"/>paused, examining and analysing\n            all the minuti&#230; of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and\n            death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me&#8212;a\n            light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the\n            immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men\n            of genius, who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone\n            should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.</p>\n          ",

I learned\n            from Werter&#8217;s imaginations despondency and gloom: but Plutarch taught me high thoughts;\n            he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the\n            heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had\n            a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and\n            boundless seas.

I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for\n            vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as\n            I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course\n            led to admire peaceable law-givers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus\n            and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\n            firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a\n            young soldier, burning for glory and <pb n=\"104\" xml:id=\"F1818_v2_108\"/>slaughter, I\n            should have been imbued with different sensations.</p>\n          ",

I repassed, in my memory, my whole\n            life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my\n            mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt.
