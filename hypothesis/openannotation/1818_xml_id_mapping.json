Critics of the novel have not often followed this lead in thinking about it as an early work in the British evolutionary imagination. Erasmus Darwin had made \"not of impossible occurrence\" that one presently visible species could mutate into another. Victor contemplates this possibility\u2014as an alarming one\u2014when he speculates in Volume 3, Chapter 3, that the Creature's demand that he create a \"mate\" could result in a new evolutionary development, \"a race of devils.\"",

In his review of the first edition in 1818 for *Edinburgh Magaizine*, Sir Walter Scott seems cognizant of the shift in consciousness. He notes: \"The real events of the world have, in our day, too, been of so wondrous and gigantic a kind--the shiftings of the scenes in our stupendous drama have been so rapid and various, that Shakespeare himself, in his wildest flights, has been completely distanced by the eccentricities of actual existence.\"",

I opened it\n            with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the <pb xml:id=\"F1818_v1_064\" n=\"052\"/>wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this\n            feeling into enthusiasm.

My father looked carelessly at the title-page of\n            my book, and said, &#8220;Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon\n            this; it is sad trash.&#8221;</p>\n          "

Whence, I often asked myself,\n            did the <pb xml:id=\"F1818_v1_094\" n=\"082\"/>principle of life proceed? It was a bold\n            question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things\n            are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not\n            restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined\n            thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy\n            which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural\n            enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost\n            intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I\n            became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also\n            observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father\n            had taken the <pb xml:id=\"F1818_v1_095\" n=\"083\"/>greatest precautions that my mind\n            should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have\n            trembled at a tale of superstition, or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.\n            Darkness had no effect upon my fancy; and a church-yard was to me merely the receptacle\n            of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had\n            become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay,\n            and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses. My attention was fixed\n            upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw\n            how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death\n            succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the\n            eye and brain. I <pb xml:id=\"F1818_v1_096\" n=\"084\"/>paused, examining and analysing\n            all the minuti&#230; of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and\n            death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me&#8212;a\n            light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the\n            immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men\n            of genius, who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone\n            should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.</p>\n          "

Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I\n            had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point\n            them towards <pb xml:id=\"F1818_v1_098\" n=\"086\"/>the object of my search, than to\n            exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried\n            with the dead, and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering, and seemingly\n            ineffectual, light.</p>\n          "

Historically, Jewish rabbis were also thought to have created golems from clay to seek revenge on enemies. However, following orders literally, the golems inevitably became destructive. Cautionary tales about technology and hubris were not only frequent in Shelley's time but have proliferated. In Karel \u010capek's *R.U.R* (1920), for example, robots confound expectations by violently rebelling against their creators. Cadavers for anatomical training in this period were scarce, and thus a medical education meant to study and extend life also fostered serial killers who committed murders for the sake of selling fresh corpses. Such killing sprees were ended by the Anatomical Act of 1832 in England, which made corpses legally available for medical research. ",

My cheek had grown pale with study, and\n            my person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of\n            certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour\n            might realize. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated\n            myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\n            eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my\n            secret toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured the\n            living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with\n            the remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost frantic impulse, urged me forward; I\n            seemed to <pb xml:id=\"F1818_v1_103\" n=\"091\"/>have lost all soul or sensation but for\n            this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with\n            renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned\n            to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel houses; and disturbed, with profane\n            fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather\n            cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery\n            and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\n            their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the\n            slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with\n            loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually\n            increased, <pb xml:id=\"F1818_v1_104\" n=\"092\"/>I brought my work near to a\n            conclusion.</p>\n          "

But, besides that he is not at all fitted\n            for such an occupation, it is certainly more creditable to cultivate the earth for the\n            sustenance of man, than to be the confidant, and sometimes the accomplice, of his vices;\n            which is <pb xml:id=\"F1818_v1_129\" n=\"117\"/>the profession of a lawyer. I said, that\n            the employments of a prosperous farmer, if they were not a more honourable, they were at\n            least a happier species of occupation than that of a judge, whose misfortune it was\n            always to meddle with the dark side of human nature. My uncle smiled, and said, that I\n            ought to be an advocate myself, which put an end to the conversation on that\n            subject.</p>\n          "

One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a\n            thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which,\n            although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame\n            me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,\n            although I was unable to define them.</p>\n          "

A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its\n            shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous\n            than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\n            d&#230;mon to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the\n            conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination,\n            than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean\n            against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost <pb xml:id=\"F1818_v1_160\" n=\"148\"/>it in the gloom.

I thought of\n            pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to\n            me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Sal&#234;ve, a hill\n            that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</p>\n          "

She was warmly\n            attached to the child who is now dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate\n            mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding all the\n            evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no\n            temptation for such an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she\n            had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her; so much do I esteem\n            and value her.&#8221;</p>\n          "

The river descends\n            rapidly, and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw\n            many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high\n            and inaccessible.

As punishment for the disobedience, Zeus condemns Prometheus to eternal torment: he is chained to a rock for eternity while an eagle feeds on his liver.
