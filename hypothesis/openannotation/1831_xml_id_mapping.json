Some volumes of ghost stories, translated from the German into French, fell into our\n        hands. There was the History of the Inconstant Lover, who, when he thought to clasp the\n        bride to whom he had pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her\n        whom he had deserted.

His gigantic, shadowy form, clothed like the ghost in\n        Hamlet, in complete armour, but with the<pb n=\"viii\" xml:id=\"F1831_v_012\"/> beaver up, was\n        seen at midnight, by the moon&#8217;s fitful beams, to advance slowly along the gloomy avenue. The\n        shape was lost beneath the shadow of the castle walls; but soon a gate swung back, a step\n        was heard, the door of the chamber opened, and he advanced to the couch of the blooming\n        youths, cradled in healthy sleep. Eternal sorrow sat upon his face as he bent down and\n        kissed the forehead of the boys, who from that hour withered like flowers snapt upon the\n        stalk.

     "exact": "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this\n         circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There\n         was a\n         sense of justice in my father\u2019s upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he\n         should\n         approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from\n         the\n         late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set a greater\n         value\n         on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my\n         mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by\n         reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\n         her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour\n         to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove\n         to\n         shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind,\n         and\n         to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft\n         and\n         benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,\n         had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed\n         previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public\n         functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy,\n         and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\n         as a restorative for her weakened frame.\n      \n      \n      From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples,\n         and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their\n         only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible\n         stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother\u2019s tender\n         caresses, and my father\u2019s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my\n         first\n         recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better\u201421their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed\n         on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their\n         hands\n         to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards\n         me.\n         With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had\n         given\n         life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined\n         that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of\n         charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but\n         one\n         train of enjoyment to me.\n      \n      \n      For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desire to have a daughter,\n         but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making\n         an\n         excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake\n         of\n         Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.\n         This,\n         to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion,\u2014remembering what\n         she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,\u2014for her to act in her turn the\n         guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings\n         of\n         a vale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\n         of\n         half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day,\n         when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited\n         this\n         abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour,\n         distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which\n         attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The\n         four\n         others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin, and very fair.\n         Her\n         hair was the brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed\n         to\n         set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes\n         cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility\n         and\n         sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species,\n         a\n         being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\n      \n      \n      22The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed\n         eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.\n         She\n         was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German,\n         and\n         had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to\n         nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest\n         child\n         was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in\n         the\n         memory of the antique glory of Italy,\u2014one among the schiavi ognor\n            frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the\n         victim of its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the dungeons of\n         Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his child became an orphan and\n         a\n         beggar. She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer\n         than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\n      \n      \n      When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa,\n         a child fairer than pictured cherub\u2014a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her\n         looks, and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The\n         apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic\n         guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence\n         had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\n         and\n         want, when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their\n         village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my\n         parents\u2019 house\u2014my more than sister\u2014the beautiful and adored companion of all my\n         occupations and my pleasures.\n      \n      \n      Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which\n         all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening\n         previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,\u2014\u201cI have a\n         pretty present for my Victor\u2014to-morrow he shall have it.\u201d And when, on the morrow,\n         she\n         presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness,\n         interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine\u2014mine to protect,\n         love, and 23cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I\n         received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the\n         name\n         of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she\n         stood to me\u2014my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      CHAPTER II.\n      \n       We were brought up together; there was not quite a year\n         difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion\n         or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast\n         that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer\n         and\n         more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\n         application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied\n         herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and\n         wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home\u2014the sublime shapes of the mountains;\n         the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life\n         and\n         turbulence of our Alpine summers,\u2014she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\n         While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent\n         appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to\n         me a\n         secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden\n         laws\n         of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest\n         sensations I can remember.\n      \n      \n      On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely\n         their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a\n         house\n         in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the\n         lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally\n         in the latter, and 24the lives of my parents were passed\n         in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself\n         fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general;\n         but I\n         united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval\n         was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He\n         loved\n         enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read in books\n         of\n         chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of\n         enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into\n         masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of\n         the\n         Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem\n         the\n         holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.\n      \n      \n      No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were\n         possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not\n         the\n         tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of\n         all\n         the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly\n         discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement\n         of filial love.\n      \n      \n      My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my\n         temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire\n         to\n         learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the\n         structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states,\n         possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired\n         to\n         learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of\n         nature\n         and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed\n         to the\n         metaphysical, or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\n      \n      \n      Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.\n         The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme;\n         and his hope and his dream was to become one among those 25whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our\n         species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our\n         peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance\n         of her\n         celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit\n         of\n         love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through\n         the\n         ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own\n         gentleness. And Clerval\u2014could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?\u2014yet\n         he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity\u2014so full\n         of\n         kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded\n         to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim\n         of\n         his soaring ambition.",

There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my\n            mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by\n            reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\n            her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour\n            to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to\n            shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind, and\n            to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\n            benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,\n            had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed\n            previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public\n            functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy,\n            and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\n            as a restorative for her weakened frame.</p>\n          ",

In the 1818, Elizabeth is a blood relation--Victor's first cousin--since she is the daughter of his father's brother. In the 1831 edition, Elizabeth is instead \"discovered\" by Caroline. Caroline notices a comely blonde girl \"of a different stock\" among the dark-eyed, Italian \"vagrants.\" When Caroline learns that Elizabeth is the daughter of a Milanese nobleman and a German woman she decides that Elizabeth and Victor should someday marry. Thus the potential implication of incest in 1818, when Victor eventually weds his cousin, is erased in 1831.  \n\nSee, for instance: \n\nKetterer, David \"Thematic Anatomy: Intrinsic Structures\" in *Frankenstein: Bloom's Major Literary Characters,* ed.

He was deeply read in books of\n            chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of\n            enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into\n            masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the\n            Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the\n            holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.</p>\n          ",

On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit. His\n            manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public; for there was a\n            certain dignity in his mien during his lecture, which in his own house was replaced by\n            the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my\n            former pursuits as I had given to his fellow-professor. He heard with attention the\n            little narration concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and\n            Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said, that &#8220;these\n            were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the\n            foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new\n            names, and arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a great degree\n            had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however\n            erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of\n            mankind.&#8221; I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or\n            affectation; and then added, that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern\n            chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from\n            a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made\n            me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours.

I read\n            with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers\n            have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures, and cultivated the\n            acquaintance, of the men of science of the university; and I found even in M. Krempe a\n            great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\n            physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I\n            found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and his instructions\n            were given with an air of frankness and good nature, that banished every idea of\n            pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge, and made the most\n            abstruse enquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at first\n            fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded, and soon became so ardent\n            and eager, that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet\n            engaged in my laboratory.</p>\n          ",

You are forbidden to write\u2014to hold a pen;\n         yet\n         one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long\n         time\n         I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained\n         my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering\n         the\n         inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey; yet how often have I regretted\n         not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending\n         on\n         your sick bed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your\n         wishes, nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet\n         that\n         is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better.

You will find a happy, cheerful home, and friends who\n         love\n         you dearly. Your father\u2019s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you,\u2014but to be\n         assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.\n         How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen,\n         and\n         full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss, and to enter into\n         foreign service;50 but we cannot part with him, at least\n         until his elder brother return to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a\n         military career in a distant country; but Ernest never had your powers of application.\n         He looks upon study as an odious fetter;\u2014his time is spent in the open air, climbing\n         the\n         hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler, unless we yield\n         the\n         point, and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\n      \n      \n      \u201cLittle alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since\n         you\n         left us. The blue lake, and snow-clad mountains, they never change;\u2014and I think our\n         placid home, and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. My\n         trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions\n         by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change\n         has\n         taken place in our little household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz\n         entered our family? ",

This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed\n            aloud, &#8220;William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!&#8221; As I said these\n            words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near\n            me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\n            illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature,\n            and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly\n            informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy d&#230;mon, to whom I had given life. What did\n            he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No\n            sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my\n            teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed\n            me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that\n            fair child. <hi rend=\"italic\" xml:id=\"novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29_hi1\">He</hi> was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere\n            presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the\n            devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging\n            among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Sal&#234;ve, a hill that bounds\n            Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</p>\n          ",

It was during an access of this\n         kind\n         that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys,\n         sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my\n         ephemeral, because human, sorrows.

Six years had passed since\n         then: I was a wreck\u2014but nought had changed in those savage and\n         enduring scenes.\n      \n      \n      I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a mule,\n         as\n         the more sure-footed, and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. The\n         weather was fine: it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months\n         after the death of Justine; that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The\n         weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine\n         of\n         Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side\u2014the sound\n         of\n         the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the 79waterfalls around, spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence\u2014and I ceased to fear, or\n         to\n         bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements,\n         here displayed in their most terrific guise.

At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I\n            passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds, and listening\n            to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun\n            seldom failed to restore me to some degree <pb n=\"132\" xml:id=\"F1831_v_148\"/>of\n            composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile\n            and a more cheerful heart.</p>\n          ",

I tried to conceal this\n            as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the <pb n=\"140\" xml:id=\"F1831_v_156\"/>pleasures natural to one, who was entering on a new scene of life,\n            undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,\n            alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the\n            materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single\n            drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was\n            an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to\n            quiver, and my heart to palpitate.</p>\n          ",

As we entered this city, our minds were filled with\n            the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a\n            half before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces.

The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we\n            delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary\n            gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain\n            our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\n            magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite\n            verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic\n            assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.</p>\n          ",

The wind was high, and the waves continually\n            threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was north-east, and must\n            have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my\n            course, but quickly found that, if I again made the attempt, the boat would be instantly\n            filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\n            confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me, and was so\n            slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world, that the sun was of\n            little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic, and feel all the\n            tortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and\n            buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours, and felt the torment of a burning\n            thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by\n            clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the sea,\n            it was to be my grave. &#8220;Fiend,&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;your task is already fulfilled!&#8221; I thought\n            of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; all left behind, on whom the monster might\n            satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie, so\n            despairing and frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing\n            before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.</p>\n          ",

We took our passage on board a vessel bound for\n            Havre-de-Grace, and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores. <pb n=\"164\" xml:id=\"F1831_v_180\"/>It was midnight. I lay on the deck, looking at the\n            stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut\n            Ireland from my sight; and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I\n            should soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet\n            the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and\n            the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision, and\n            that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster\n            of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while\n            residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\n            Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the\n            creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived. I\n            was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I\n            wept bitterly.</p>\n          ",

Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions\n          towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this\n          wind of promise, my day dreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be\n          persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my\n          imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\n          visible; its broad disk just skirting the horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour.\n          There&#8212;for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators&#8212;there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a\n          land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\n          globe. Its productions and features may be without ex<pb n=\"4\" xml:id=\"F1831_v_020\"/>ample, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\n          solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover\n          the wondrous power which attracts the needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial\n          observations, that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities\n          consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the\n          world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of\n          man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or\n          death, and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when\n          he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\n          native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the\n          inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by\n          discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many\n          months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all\n          possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>\n        ",

This\n          circumstance, added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very\n          desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle\n          and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character, that I cannot\n          overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never\n          believed it to be necessary; and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his\n          kindliness of heart, and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself\n          peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather\n          a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly,\n          is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and\n          having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the\n          match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears,\n          and, throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time\n          that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to\n          the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name\n          of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\n          money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the\n          whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and\n          then himself solicited the young woman&#8217;s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.\n          But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend; who,\n          when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that\n          his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. &#8220;What a noble fellow!&#8221; you\n          will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a\n          kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more\n          astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.</p>\n        ",

Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly\n          occupied by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of\n          others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him\n          without disguise.

I paused;\n         &#8212;at length he spoke, in broken accents:&#8212;&#8220;Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you\n          drank also of the intoxicating draught?

There was a\n            sense of justice in my father&#8217;s upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he should\n            approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\n            late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set a greater value\n            on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my\n            mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by\n            reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\n            her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour\n            to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to\n            shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind, and\n            to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\n            benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,\n            had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed\n            previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public\n            functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy,\n            and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\n            as a restorative for her weakened frame.</p>\n          ",

My\n            ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the<pb n=\"37\" xml:id=\"F1831_v_053\"/> masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly\n            smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on? whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt\n            exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit\n            to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I\n            hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements\n            of science. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is\n            nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery\n            and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity, which closely pursues one study, must\n            infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the\n            attainment of one object of pursuit, and was solely wrapt up in this, improved so\n            rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I made some discoveries in the improvement of\n            some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\n            university. When I had arrived at this point, and had become as well acquainted with the\n            theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the\n            professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my\n            improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\n            happened that protracted my stay.</p>\n          ",

For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with\n            an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the\n            dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the\n            aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room, and continued a long time\n            traversing my bedchamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude\n            succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and I threw myself on the bed in my\n            clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain: I\n            slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in\n            the bloom of health, walking in the streets of<pb n=\"44\" xml:id=\"F1831_v_060\"/>\n            Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but as I imprinted the first kiss\n            on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change,\n            and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped\n            her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from\n            my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb\n            became convulsed: when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way\n            through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch&#8212;the miserable monster whom I had\n            created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called,\n            were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a\n            grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was\n            stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took\n            refuge in the court-yard belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I remained\n            during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening\n            attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of\n            the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.</p>\n          ",
