     "exact": "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this\n         circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There\n         was a\n         sense of justice in my father\u2019s upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he\n         should\n         approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from\n         the\n         late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set a greater\n         value\n         on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my\n         mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by\n         reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\n         her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour\n         to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove\n         to\n         shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind,\n         and\n         to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft\n         and\n         benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,\n         had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed\n         previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public\n         functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy,\n         and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\n         as a restorative for her weakened frame.\n      \n      \n      From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples,\n         and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their\n         only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible\n         stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother\u2019s tender\n         caresses, and my father\u2019s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my\n         first\n         recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better\u201421their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed\n         on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their\n         hands\n         to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards\n         me.\n         With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had\n         given\n         life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined\n         that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of\n         charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but\n         one\n         train of enjoyment to me.\n      \n      \n      For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desire to have a daughter,\n         but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making\n         an\n         excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake\n         of\n         Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.\n         This,\n         to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion,\u2014remembering what\n         she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,\u2014for her to act in her turn the\n         guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings\n         of\n         a vale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\n         of\n         half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day,\n         when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited\n         this\n         abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour,\n         distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which\n         attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The\n         four\n         others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin, and very fair.\n         Her\n         hair was the brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed\n         to\n         set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes\n         cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility\n         and\n         sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species,\n         a\n         being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\n      \n      \n      22The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed\n         eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.\n         She\n         was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German,\n         and\n         had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to\n         nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest\n         child\n         was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in\n         the\n         memory of the antique glory of Italy,\u2014one among the schiavi ognor\n            frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the\n         victim of its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the dungeons of\n         Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his child became an orphan and\n         a\n         beggar. She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer\n         than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\n      \n      \n      When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa,\n         a child fairer than pictured cherub\u2014a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her\n         looks, and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The\n         apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic\n         guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence\n         had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\n         and\n         want, when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their\n         village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my\n         parents\u2019 house\u2014my more than sister\u2014the beautiful and adored companion of all my\n         occupations and my pleasures.\n      \n      \n      Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which\n         all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening\n         previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,\u2014\u201cI have a\n         pretty present for my Victor\u2014to-morrow he shall have it.\u201d And when, on the morrow,\n         she\n         presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness,\n         interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine\u2014mine to protect,\n         love, and 23cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I\n         received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the\n         name\n         of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she\n         stood to me\u2014my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      CHAPTER II.\n      \n       We were brought up together; there was not quite a year\n         difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion\n         or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast\n         that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer\n         and\n         more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\n         application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied\n         herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and\n         wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home\u2014the sublime shapes of the mountains;\n         the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life\n         and\n         turbulence of our Alpine summers,\u2014she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\n         While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent\n         appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to\n         me a\n         secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden\n         laws\n         of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest\n         sensations I can remember.\n      \n      \n      On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely\n         their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a\n         house\n         in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the\n         lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally\n         in the latter, and 24the lives of my parents were passed\n         in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself\n         fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general;\n         but I\n         united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval\n         was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He\n         loved\n         enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read in books\n         of\n         chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of\n         enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into\n         masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of\n         the\n         Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem\n         the\n         holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.\n      \n      \n      No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were\n         possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not\n         the\n         tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of\n         all\n         the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly\n         discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement\n         of filial love.\n      \n      \n      My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my\n         temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire\n         to\n         learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the\n         structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states,\n         possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired\n         to\n         learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of\n         nature\n         and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed\n         to the\n         metaphysical, or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\n      \n      \n      Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.\n         The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme;\n         and his hope and his dream was to become one among those 25whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our\n         species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our\n         peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance\n         of her\n         celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit\n         of\n         love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through\n         the\n         ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own\n         gentleness. And Clerval\u2014could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?\u2014yet\n         he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity\u2014so full\n         of\n         kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded\n         to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim\n         of\n         his soaring ambition.",

There was a sense of justice in my father&#8217;s upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind, and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.</ns6:p> \n            "

In the 1818, Elizabeth is a blood relation--Victor's first cousin--since she is the daughter of his father's brother. In the 1831 edition, Elizabeth is instead \"discovered\" by Caroline. Caroline notices a comely blonde girl \"of a different stock\" among the dark-eyed, Italian \"vagrants.\" When Caroline learns that Elizabeth is the daughter of a Milanese nobleman and a German woman she decides that Elizabeth and Victor should someday marry. Thus the potential implication of incest in 1818, when Victor eventually weds his cousin, is erased in 1831.  \n\nSee, for instance: \n\nKetterer, David \"Thematic Anatomy: Intrinsic Structures\" in *Frankenstein: Bloom's Major Literary Characters,* ed.

In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of\n         modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir\n         Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside\n         the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of\n         natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy\u2019s apprehensions,\n         as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.\n      \n      \n      The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their\n         practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled\n         the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.\n         He\n         might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\n         in\n         their secondary and tertiary grades were 27utterly\n         unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to\n         keep\n         human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had\n         repined.\n      \n      \n      But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I\n         took\n         their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange\n         that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine\n         of\n         education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard\n         to\n         my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with\n         a\n         child\u2019s blindness, added to a student\u2019s thirst for knowledge.

I attended the lectures, and cultivated the <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app16-f1831\">acquaintance, </ns8:seg>of the men of science of the university; and I found even in <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app20-f1831\">M. </ns8:seg>Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app23-f1831\">information, combined, </ns8:seg>it is <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app25-f1831\">true, </ns8:seg>with a repulsive <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app27-f1831\">physiognomy </ns8:seg>and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app32-f1831\">dogmatism; </ns8:seg>and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app36-f1831\">nature, </ns8:seg>that banished every idea of <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app39-f1831\">pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge, and made the most abstruse enquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded, </ns8:seg>and <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app77-f1831\">soon </ns8:seg>became so ardent and <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app80-f1831\">eager, </ns8:seg>that the stars often <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app82-f1831\">disappeared </ns8:seg>in the light of morning <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app85-f1831\">whilst </ns8:seg>I was yet <ns8:seg xml:id=\"C09_app87-f1831\">engaged </ns8:seg>in my <ns8:seg part=\"I\" xml:id=\"C09_app89-f1831__I\">laboratory.</ns8:seg>\n            </ns8:p>\n            "
