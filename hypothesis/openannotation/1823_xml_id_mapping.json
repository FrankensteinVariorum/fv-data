I\n         was\n         easily led by the sympathy which he evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give\n         utterance to the burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that\n         warmed\n         me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the\n         furtherance of my enterprise. One man\u2019s life or death were but a small price to pay\n         for\n         the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought; for the dominion I should acquire\n         and\n         transmit over the elemental foes of our race.

He asked me the history of my earlier years.\n         The\n         tale was quickly told: 16but it awakened various trains of\n         reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend\u2014of my thirst for a more intimate\n         sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and expressed my conviction\n         that a man could boast of little happiness, who did not enjoy this blessing.\n      \n      \n      \u201cI agree with you,\u201d replied the stranger; \u201cwe are unfashioned creatures, but half\n         made\n         up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves\u2014such a friend ought to be\u2014do not lend\n         his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.",

     "exact": "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this\n         circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There\n         was a\n         sense of justice in my father\u2019s upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he\n         should\n         approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from\n         the\n         late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set a greater\n         value\n         on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my\n         mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by\n         reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\n         her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour\n         to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove\n         to\n         shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind,\n         and\n         to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft\n         and\n         benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,\n         had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed\n         previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public\n         functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy,\n         and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\n         as a restorative for her weakened frame.\n      \n      \n      From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples,\n         and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their\n         only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible\n         stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother\u2019s tender\n         caresses, and my father\u2019s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my\n         first\n         recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better\u201421their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed\n         on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their\n         hands\n         to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards\n         me.\n         With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had\n         given\n         life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined\n         that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of\n         charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but\n         one\n         train of enjoyment to me.\n      \n      \n      For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desire to have a daughter,\n         but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making\n         an\n         excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake\n         of\n         Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.\n         This,\n         to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion,\u2014remembering what\n         she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,\u2014for her to act in her turn the\n         guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings\n         of\n         a vale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\n         of\n         half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day,\n         when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited\n         this\n         abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour,\n         distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which\n         attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The\n         four\n         others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin, and very fair.\n         Her\n         hair was the brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed\n         to\n         set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes\n         cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility\n         and\n         sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species,\n         a\n         being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\n      \n      \n      22The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed\n         eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.\n         She\n         was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German,\n         and\n         had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to\n         nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest\n         child\n         was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in\n         the\n         memory of the antique glory of Italy,\u2014one among the schiavi ognor\n            frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the\n         victim of its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the dungeons of\n         Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his child became an orphan and\n         a\n         beggar. She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer\n         than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\n      \n      \n      When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa,\n         a child fairer than pictured cherub\u2014a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her\n         looks, and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The\n         apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic\n         guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence\n         had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\n         and\n         want, when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their\n         village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my\n         parents\u2019 house\u2014my more than sister\u2014the beautiful and adored companion of all my\n         occupations and my pleasures.\n      \n      \n      Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which\n         all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening\n         previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,\u2014\u201cI have a\n         pretty present for my Victor\u2014to-morrow he shall have it.\u201d And when, on the morrow,\n         she\n         presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness,\n         interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine\u2014mine to protect,\n         love, and 23cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I\n         received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the\n         name\n         of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she\n         stood to me\u2014my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      CHAPTER II.\n      \n       We were brought up together; there was not quite a year\n         difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion\n         or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast\n         that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer\n         and\n         more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\n         application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied\n         herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and\n         wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home\u2014the sublime shapes of the mountains;\n         the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life\n         and\n         turbulence of our Alpine summers,\u2014she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\n         While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent\n         appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to\n         me a\n         secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden\n         laws\n         of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest\n         sensations I can remember.\n      \n      \n      On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely\n         their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a\n         house\n         in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the\n         lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally\n         in the latter, and 24the lives of my parents were passed\n         in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself\n         fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general;\n         but I\n         united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval\n         was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He\n         loved\n         enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read in books\n         of\n         chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of\n         enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into\n         masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of\n         the\n         Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem\n         the\n         holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.\n      \n      \n      No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were\n         possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not\n         the\n         tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of\n         all\n         the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly\n         discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement\n         of filial love.\n      \n      \n      My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my\n         temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire\n         to\n         learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the\n         structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states,\n         possessed attractions for me.

The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our\n         peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance\n         of her\n         celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit\n         of\n         love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through\n         the\n         ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own\n         gentleness. And Clerval\u2014could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?\u2014yet\n         he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity\u2014so full\n         of\n         kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded\n         to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim\n         of\n         his soaring ambition.",

In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of\n         modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir\n         Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside\n         the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of\n         natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy\u2019s apprehensions,\n         as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.\n      \n      \n      The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their\n         practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled\n         the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.\n         He\n         might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\n         in\n         their secondary and tertiary grades were 27utterly\n         unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to\n         keep\n         human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had\n         repined.\n      \n      \n      But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I\n         took\n         their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange\n         that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine\n         of\n         education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard\n         to\n         my favourite studies.

On this\n         occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by\n         this\n         catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the\n         subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.\n         All\n         that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and\n         Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these\n         men\n         disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would\n         or\n         could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.\n         By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject to in early\n         youth, I at once gave up my former occupations; set down natural history and all its\n         progeny as a deformed and abortive creation; and entertained the greatest disdain\n         for a\n         would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge.\n         In\n         this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches of study\n         appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy\n         of\n         my consideration.\n      \n      \n      Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound\n         to\n         prosperity or ruin.

Her victory was announced by an unusual\n         tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the relinquishing of my ancient\n         and\n         latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil\n         with\n         their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.\n      \n      \n      29It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it\n         was ineffectual.

You are forbidden to write\u2014to hold a pen;\n         yet\n         one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long\n         time\n         I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained\n         my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering\n         the\n         inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey; yet how often have I regretted\n         not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending\n         on\n         your sick bed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your\n         wishes, nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet\n         that\n         is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that\n         you\n         will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.\n      \n      \n      \u201cGet well\u2014and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home, and friends who\n         love\n         you dearly. Your father\u2019s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you,\u2014but to be\n         assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.\n         How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen,\n         and\n         full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss, and to enter into\n         foreign service;50 but we cannot part with him, at least\n         until his elder brother return to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a\n         military career in a distant country; but Ernest never had your powers of application.\n         He looks upon study as an odious fetter;\u2014his time is spent in the open air, climbing\n         the\n         hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler, unless we yield\n         the\n         point, and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\n      \n      \n      \u201cLittle alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since\n         you\n         left us. The blue lake, and snow-clad mountains, they never change;\u2014and I think our\n         placid home, and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. My\n         trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions\n         by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change\n         has\n         taken place in our little household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz\n         entered our family? ",

The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a\n            troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.

Even as she spoke\n         I\n         drew near to her, as if in terror; lest at that very moment the destroyer had been\n         near\n         to rob me of her. \n      \n      \n      Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could\n         redeem my soul from woe: the very accents of love were ineffectual.

My wanderings were directed towards the valley\n         of\n         Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood.

I afterwards hired a mule,\n         as\n         the more sure-footed, and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. The\n         weather was fine: it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months\n         after the death of Justine; that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The\n         weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine\n         of\n         Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side\u2014the sound\n         of\n         the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the 79waterfalls around, spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence\u2014and I ceased to fear, or\n         to\n         bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements,\n         here displayed in their most terrific guise.

The light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I\n            walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near\n            Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt\n            tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate\n            some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my\n            thirst at the brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p>\n          ",

Do you understand this feeling? This\n          breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a\n          foretaste of those icy climes.

There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the\n          horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There&#8212;for with your leave, my sister, I will\n          put some trust in preceding navigators&#8212;there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing\n          over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and <pb n=\"3\" xml:id=\"F1823_v1_022\"/>in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\n          globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the\n          heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected\n          in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the\n          needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial observations, that require only this voyage\n          to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent\n          curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land\n          never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are\n          sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death, and to induce me to commence this\n          laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he <pb n=\"4\" xml:id=\"F1823_v1_023\"/>embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\n          native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the\n          inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by\n          discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many\n          months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all\n          possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>\n        ",

The first version had made a special point of indicating how this family education was not inculcated by punishments, but presented to the children as an adventure in knowledge, as well as preparing Victor for the kind of rigorous study he would later undertake in the modern sciences.\n     Instead of this pedagogical detail, Mary generalizes about Victor's happy childhood and replaces the details of education with the idea of a \"religious and sacred feeling\" that is inimical to the secular education described in 1818.

Whence, I often asked myself,\n            did the <pb n=\"82\" xml:id=\"F1823_v1_101\"/>principle of life proceed? It was a bold\n            question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things\n            are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not\n            restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined\n            thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy\n            which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural\n            enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost\n            intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I\n            became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also\n            observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father\n            had taken the greatest precautions that my mind <pb n=\"83\" xml:id=\"F1823_v1_102\"/>should\n            be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a\n            tale of superstition, or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no\n            effect upon my fancy; and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies\n            deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for\n            the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced to\n            spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every\n            object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine\n            form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the\n            blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I\n            paused, examining and <pb n=\"84\" xml:id=\"F1823_v1_103\"/>analysing all the minuti&#230; of\n            causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until\n            from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me&#8212;a light so brilliant and\n            wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect\n            which it illustrated, I was surprised, that among so many men of genius who had directed\n            their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so\n            astonishing a secret.</p>\n          ",

He still remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my\n            mother, which stood over the mantelpiece. It was an historical subject, painted at my\n            father&#8217;s desire, and re<pb n=\"152\" xml:id=\"F1823_v1_171\"/>presented Caroline Beaufort in\n            an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and\n            her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\n            sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed\n            when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive,\n            and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me: &#8220;Welcome, my\n            dearest Victor,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would\n            have found us all joyous and delighted. But we are now unhappy; and, I am afraid, tears\n            instead of smiles will be your welcome. Our father looks so sorrowful: this dreadful\n            event seems to have revived in his mind his grief on the death of mamma. Poor <pb n=\"153\" xml:id=\"F1823_v1_172\"/>Elizabeth, also, is quite inconsolable.&#8221; Ernest began\n            to weep as he said these words.</p>\n          ",

Induced by these feelings,\n            I was of course led to admire peaceable law-givers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in\n            preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these\n            impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to\n            humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and <pb n=\"36\" xml:id=\"F1823_v2_309\"/>slaughter, I should have been imbued with different\n            sensations.</p>\n          ",
