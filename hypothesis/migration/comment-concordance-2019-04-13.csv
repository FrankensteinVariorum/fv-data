"From Romantic Circles:
""Percy Bysshe Shelley, feigning the author's being abroad, handled the negotiations for a contract to publish Frankenstein, thus preserving Mary Shelley's anonymity. That he first sought out John Murray, Byron's publisher, may indicate that Byron himself suggested such an avenue to the Shelleys. Whatever the case, Murray declined the manuscript, upon whose refusal Shelley reverted to his own publisher Charles Ollier. When Ollier, too, declined to accept the book, the Shelleys were in something of a quandary. They resolved it by turning to a publishing house—Lackington's—that had a large inventory and specialized somewhat in sensational materials.""
